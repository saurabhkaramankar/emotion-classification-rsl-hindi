Emotional classification is the extension to sentiment classification. In sentiment classification, we 
classify the sentence into positive and negative categories. Sentiment analysis is further extended 
into opinion and emotion classification. Here, we mainly focus on emotional classification. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT
Classification of a Hindi sentence into its respective emotion. 

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
 To Implement Emotion classifier using EmotionNet and centrality measures, 
 To compare it against Multilingual BERT for emotion classification. The EmotionNet 
approach needs huge data to get good accuracy. Instead, Bert model can be used hence it 
has self-attention from both direction it can give better scores.
 To compare it against CNN Model based emotion analysis for Hindi language. CNN model 
is one of the basic deep learning techniques used for classification. This model is can extract 
local features and position-invariant features
